\section{Cosmology}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Put on a timeline, and describe the principal events in the thermal history of the
universe, from $kT = 10$ TeV to $kT = 0.1$ eV.
\item Give a semi-quantitative discussion of the connection between flucuations of the
cosmic microwave background on angular scales of arcminutes to degrees, and the
baryonic structures (galaxies, clusters, correlations of galaxies) observed in the local
universe, redshift $z < 0.5$.
\item Which elements/isotopes are produced in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and in what
quantities? Explain qualitatively how the yield of each depends on the cosmic baryon
density and why.
\end{enumerate}
