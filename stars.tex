\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain what is the Hayashi track, and describe what types of objects live on it.
      Qualitatively explain how it arises and what assumptions are required for its derivation.
\item Estimate the temperature as a function of depth in the Sun's convection zone. What
      is the temperature at the base of the convection zone?
\item Describe the major sources of opacity in stars, and how each depends on density,
      temperature, and metallicity.
\end{enumerate}
