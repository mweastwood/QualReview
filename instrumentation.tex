\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe quantitatively the point spread function of a diffraction-limited optical
      telescope. Explain how diffraction spikes arise, and what determines their positions
      and intensities. Under what circumstances will the PSF be broadened by atmospheric
      turbulence?
\item Derive an expression for the point source sensitivity of a radio interferometer as
      a function of the frequency, bandwidth, system temperature, diameter of each dish,
      number of dishes, etc.
\item Describe some of the common technologies for detecting gamma rays, the approxi-
      mate energy range over which they are applicable, and some of their main advantages
      and disadvantages.
\end{enumerate}
