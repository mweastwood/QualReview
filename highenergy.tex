\section{High Energy}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the mechanisms by which cosmic rays gain and lose energy. Which mechanisms
      are appropriate to which type of particle? Which ones produce electromagnetic
      radiation that we can observe, and in what wave bands?
\item Discuss the equation of state of relativistic/nonrelativistic degenerate gases of electrons
      and neutrons and derive the Chandrasekhar mass limit for white dwarfs. (A
      heuristic approach, as in Shapiro and Teukolsky, is sufficient.)
\item Derive the equation for the effective temperature of an accretion disk around a
      black hole of mass $M$ with accretion rate $\dot M$, as a function of radius $r$. Specify the
      assumptions required to get an answer, and comment on what could go wrong with
      them. Define the Eddington luminosity and explain its relevance to the peak frequency
      of the emitted radiation.
