\section{Radiative Processes}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the total power and characteristic frequency of synchrotron radiation from
      a relativistic particle of mass m, charge e, and energy E moving in a magnetic field B.
      Use this to explain why synchrotron radiation is generally negligible for protons.
\item Explain the connection between detailed balance, the Einstein A and B relations,
      Kirchoff's law and the Milne relations, and give an example of their use to connect the
      bremsstrahlung emission spectrum and the free-free absorption coefficient.
\item Draw the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and identify which transitions are
      allowed. Which ones are in the visible part of the spectrum? Which level has no
      allowed decays, and what is its main decay mode?
\end{enumerate}
