\section{The Interstellar Medium}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw the cooling function for gas of solar metallicity, and describe the cooling
      mechanisms in each part of the curve. Explain the relevance of this function to multi-
      phase ISM models.
\item Draw a typical spectrum of an HII region, including both lines and continuum, and
      explain the major processes that give rise to each feature.
\item Explain quantitatively what determines the temperature of dust grains and their
      thermal emission spectrum. Give examples of astrophysical environments with different
      dust temperatures.
\end{enumerate}
