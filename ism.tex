\section{The Interstellar Medium}

I added sections based on the list of important topics Allison gave us 
before the final. 

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Draw the cooling function for gas of solar metallicity, and describe the cooling
      mechanisms in each part of the curve. Explain the relevance of this function to multi-
      phase ISM models.}
\item \textbf{Draw a typical spectrum of an HII region, including both lines and continuum, and
      explain the major processes that give rise to each feature.}

      thermal emission spectrum. Give examples of astrophysical environments with different
      dust temperatures.}

\subsection{Basic Things about ISM Phases}

The ISM phases are characterized by the state of hydrogen gas.

H$_2$ (molecular): $n \sim 200-10^6~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, $T \sim 10-500~{\rm K}$

Exists in molecular clouds and dark clouds, as well as protostellar cores.  
Molecular and dark clouds (lower end of the temperature and density range) are 
detected based extinction of background stars.  Giant molecular clouds 
have temperatures of $50-100$ K and and are heated by newly formed massive 
stars.  These are also seen in extinction, and in line emission in the far-IR 
and radio.  The molecular H itself is very difficult to detect 
spectroscopically, but other molecules in the clouds such as CO can be 
detected.  Giant molecular clouds have masses of 
$10^3-10^6\ M_{\odot}$.  The hottest and densist H$_2$ is found in protostellar 
cores, which are collapsed regions of GMCs.  

HI (atomic): $n \sim 1-100~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, $T \sim 100-3000~{\rm K}$

Atomic H is found in diffuse clouds.  These clouds are semitransparent, with 
visual extinction of $\sim1$ mag.  The are observed using $21$ cm emission 
(warmer clouds) and absorption (cooler clouds).  In the centers of the clouds, 
molecules such as CO and OH can form and be shielded from starlight.  These 
clouds are also visible in the infrared from their blackbody radiation.  
 
HII (ionized): $n \sim 0.1-10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, $T \sim 10^4-10^6~{\rm K}$

Ionized H is found in emission nebulae (planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, 
and HII regions).  Observationally, ionized H can be observed using H 
recombination lines (such as H$\alpha$) and other atomic recombination lines 
such as [OIII].  Bremsstrahlung emission is also seen in these regions.  
Supernova remnants and planetary nebulae have well defined shell-like shapes 
and are associated with individual stars.  HII regions appear fuzzy and 
are associated with sites of multiple star formation and molecular clouds.  
Planetary nebulae can also be distinguished from HII regions from line ratios.  
The star at the center of a planetary nebula is the core of an evolved star, 
and can be $>10^5$ K.  This produces much higher energy photons than those 
in HII regions, so ratios of [OIII] to H$\alpha$ are higher in planetary 
nebulae, and even He recombination lines are weakly visible.  

Ionized H can also be found in galactic coronal gas in the halo.  This gas 
is most likely heated $10^5-10^6$ K gas is most likely heated by shocks from 
multiple supernovae.  It can be detected from X-ray emission and UV absorption.
 
 Transitions between phases:
 
 Ionization of neutral hydrogen requires $13.6~{\rm eV}$, or photons with wavelength $\lambda < 912 \AA$, OR shocks that are faster than $50~{\rm km/s}$. In HII regions around hot (O,B) stars, the hydrogen is photoionized by the UV radiation from the star, and there are very sharp transitions between the HII, HI, and H$_2$ regions around the star.

\subsection{Phases of a Supernova}
\newthought{Anneila mentioned that} this was a fairly popular question on the quals, so
I believe a brief review of the phases of a supernova is relevant.  This focuses on the
supernova remnant as opposed to the supernova mechanism itself.  Please edit this if I wrote
something that is wrong or could be explained better -- this is the point of using git.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The free-expansion phase

    This phase is defined by the fact that the velocity of the ejecta is constant with time. This is also known as ``homologous expansion" because the shape of the density profile remains the same. For every shell of the expanding ejecta, the distance from the source $r = vt$. The condition for being in this phase is that $M_{\rm ejecta} \ll M_{\rm swept}$, that is, the mass swept up by the ejecta from the ISM is not a significant fraction of the ejecta mass.
    The expanding mass of ejecta creates a shock that travels outwards through the ISM
    and a reverse shock that travels inwards through the ejecta.  The reverse shock has a finite
    amount of material to travel through and dies away.
    The outward traveling shock heats the ISM behind it to very high temperatures.
    Thermal bremsstrahlung is seen
    in X-rays, and synchrotron emission is seen in radio from ejected
    particles spiralling around $\mu$G magnetic fields.  This phase ends after 10s to 100s of
    years when the mass of the swept up from the ISM is comparable to the mass of the ejecta.
    Recall that high-mass stars (the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) typically
    drive large stellar winds.

    \item The adiabatic phase (also called Sedov-Taylor or Blast Wave phase)

    In this phase, the mass of the swept up ISM dominates the mass of the ejected material ($M_{\rm swept} > M_{\rm ejecta}$).
    However, the density of the material behind the shock is not yet large enough for cooling
    to be significant.  Therefore, the gas expands adiabatically.
    From dimensional analysis considerations, we can derive the Sedov-Taylor solution which says
    \begin{dmath}
        R \sim \left(\frac{Et^2}{\rho}\right)^{1/5}
    \end{dmath},
    where $R$ is the radius of the supernova remnant, $E$ is the energy released by the
    supernova, and $\rho$ is the density of the surrounding ISM. The Sedov phase usually lasts about $10^4$ years.

    \item The radiative phase (or snowplow phase)
    
    This is also called the momentum-conserving phase. Consider a shell with mass $M_s$ and velocity $v_s$. The momentum $p_0 = M_s v_s$ is constant, giving the equation of motion
    \begin{equation}
    p_0 - \biggl(\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho_0 \biggr) \dot{R}\,\, ,
    \end{equation}
    which can be integrated to show that
    \begin{equation}
    R \propto t^{1/4}\,\,.
    \end{equation}
    \item Merger with the ISM
    
    Occurs when $v_s = c_s$ is the sound speed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Fluid Equations}
The following are the ideal or ``inviscid" fluid equations.

Mass conservation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \vec{\nabla} \cdot \rho \vec{v} = 0
\end{equation}

Momentum conservation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\rho \vec{v}) + \vec{\nabla}\cdot (\rho \vec{v} \vec{v}) = -\vec{\nabla} P + \rho \vec{f}
\end{equation}

Energy conservation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \biggl( \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho \epsilon \biggr) + \vec{\nabla}\biggl[\biggl(\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho \epsilon \biggr) + P \vec{v} \biggr] = \rho \vec{f} \cdot \vec{v}\,\,.
\end{equation}
The right-hand side of this equation is the work done by external forces (other people should feel free to add to this section or add different forms of the equations). Also, the Lagrangian or ``comoving" time derivative is

\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{\nabla})\,\, ,
\end{equation}
where $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is the Eulerian time derivative, not comoving with the fluid.

It's probably good to know basically how to do perturbation theory on these equations, which you can do by saying $\rho \rightarrow \rho_0 + \delta \rho$ and the same with $P$ and $v$ (assume $v_0 = 0$), then killing all the terms that are second-order in $\delta$ quantities.

It's also a good idea to know Bernoulli's equation:
\begin{equation}
(\vec{v}\cdot \vec{\nabla})\biggl(\frac{1}{2} v^2 + h + \phi \biggr) = 0\,\, .
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} v^2 + h + \phi = {\rm constant}
\end{equation}
along every streamline. The first term is kinetic energy, the second is gravitational potential energy, and and third is thermal energy $+$ work that can be done.
