\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define two-body relaxation and estimate its time scale in (a) a globular cluster; (b)
      the Milky Way's disk. In which cases is two-body relaxation important?
\item Draw qualitatively the spectral energy distribution of the Milky Way, and describe
      how its morphology might appear to an external observer as a function of wavelength.
\item Describe at least three methods to probe the gravitational potential of galaxies,
      their assumptions, and their realm of applicability.
\end{enumerate}
